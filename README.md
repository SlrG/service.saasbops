## Description

This addon is intended to autoselect the audio/subtitles for series
stored in the library and video files not in the library.
(not Movies as Kodi already remembers last selected)

Just select whatever audio/subtitle you want for your episode in a series
(while it is playing) and this addon will remember and reapply the same
settings when playing other episodes from the same series.

## Background of the original Author

I like to watch movies/series with the orignal audio and Dutch (preferred)
or English subtitles.

However in Kodi you can not setup multiple languages for subtitles.
Audio is often tagged (what I consider) wrong in my sources so Kodi can
also not help there.

There are other auto select addons that try to guess the correct audio/
subtitle tracks based on tags/tracknames/genre or more complex logic. I
found that these addons required quite some effort to get setup correctly
with a lot of going back and forth between playing an episode and back to
the addon settings and then still there were cases where it dod not work
as expected which then required debugging again.

So I decided to make an addon that does not try to guess, but just
re-apply settings that were set by the user before on other episodes.

This means that you need to once set the audio/subtitle correctly for the
first episode you watch of a series (if Kodi selects the "wrong" ones).
This is easily done when buttons to cycle the audio/subtitle settings
are on your remote. The addon will try to remember that setting and 
reapply that setting for the following episodes.

The downside of this method is that it _does_ require consistent naming
of audio/subtitle tracks, but consistency between episodes seems to be
quite common judging from my collection.
